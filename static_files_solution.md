# Static Files Configuration in Production

To fix the static files 404 errors in production mode (DEBUG=False), the following changes have been made:

1. Added WhiteNoise to serve static files efficiently in production
2. Configured STATIC_ROOT to collect static files
3. Added WhiteNoise middleware
4. Set up WhiteNoise storage backend

## Required Steps

1. Install WhiteNoise:
```bash
pip install whitenoise==6.6.0
```

2. Collect static files:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

3. Restart your application

The static files should now work correctly in production mode. Make sure to run collectstatic whenever you update your static files.
